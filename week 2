For my lego project I made a lego spaceship that contained 20 pieces. When composing my instruction set it was fairly easy because it was just Legos. For example, "connect 2x6 white lego to the 2x4 blue lego piece". Originally, for my instruction set i had only 7 steps because my piece only contained 10 pieces at irst. But when i saw that my project was too plain i had to add another 10 pieces to make my instruction set harder instead of it being so easy. My isntruction set ended with 13 steps to create my space ship. When my instruction set was used the feedback given to me was that in one of my steps it should have been put into 2 steps or add 2 pictures instead of 1. This is because the 1st picture did not not show the step properly and hid one part of the legos being attached. The person that used my instruction set found my spaceship easy to built and that was the only feedback given to me.
The audience for my project would be children. My instruction was extrememly easy to follow and clear.
To deliver my instructions i used google slides. I used google slides because i am very familiar with using it. The factors that made me use this is my experience with it. I have been using google slides or powerpoint for years. Google slides made it easy for my audience as well because most people are familar with powerpoint and google slides and how to use it. 
This week I learned how to make an instruction set for an audience. I learned how to make an undertandable intruction set. However, the legos were kind of easy. I am looking forward to making instruction sets for more complex things like cook books etc.
