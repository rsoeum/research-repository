My name is richard Soeum I am 17 years old my birthday is november 19th 2001. I have three brothers one is my twin matthew and he is super super cool. Ive played soccer all my life.  Ive had the luxury of playing the prestigeous soccer club washington premier. With this club ive been allowed to travel to over 5 different states displaying my skills. I play center mid with my brother and we're like a duo.
Before we started this class i had no idea what it was. But my brother matthew told me i should take it so i said okay. When asked what technical writing was i had trouble creating my own definition as for i had no certain answers myself. Whan kason defined it it all made sense to me. That we're writing instructions somewhat for people to use. I thought this was cool because its a real life skill many should have. 
If i am being honest when we started working on git hub i had lots of troubles. I eventually pulled through but it took sometime. I am still confused on some aspects of the website but im sure with time and adjustment ill become familiar with using it easily. Key characteristics of the website are the collaborators aspect. I thinks its very helpful as you can pull other ideas from other creators to help you further your own understandings. 
The audience for the program hisorian is for those who need help. persay students or even teachers just those who want to learn on specific things the program historian has. The historians purpose is to inform as act as a archive for information i believe. The peirce hacker audience is for students and staff of the school. The purpose of pierce hacker is to inform the people of the school i think. the writers publish their work publicly so it can help those who can benefit from it.
this week ive learned a good amount if i am being honest. Git hub was a big step for me because it was very foreign but im sure i learned the basics that can help me get through the class.
